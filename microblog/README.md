### About This Work
This microblog project is started for me to learn basic flask usage to build a website. All codes were written by me, referencing the following tutorial:
https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world

After the basic structure was completed, I turned on to the SurfingPenguin project, so this one is left undone.

### Functionalities
User-associated functions are completed, the website now provides the following usage:
> Register,  
> Login,  
> Write self-introduction,  
> Follow other users 

Functions to post articles are left undone.

### Prerequisites
Python 3 is required.
All packages needed are listed in requirements.txt.
You may use the following command to load them if you already have python 3.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Program
The codes now can only be run on localhost.
Under current directory, the following commands help you start the server of the website.
```
export FLASK_APP=surfing_penguin.py
flask run
```
